# Dry-Run Inputs Guide

All dry-run operations require a JSON input file describing the entity to be changed.

## Recommended Location
Inputs should be stored in:
`<agentRoot>\inputs\dry-run\`

## Security Restrictions
- Input files **must** be located within the `agentRoot` directory.
- Attempts to read input files from external or sensitive directories are blocked.
- The input path is validated by `PathGuard` to ensure it is within a writable root.
- Prefer `inputs/dry-run/` for all operator-provided input files.
- The operation manifest stores the parsed JSON input for auditability. Do not place secrets, API keys, credentials, tokens or private data in dry-run input files.
- Error messages should identify the blocked input rule without exposing more external path detail than necessary.
